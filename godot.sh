# godot.sh - aka: GET GODOT
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
# This script will check out and build the source for Godot Engine.
# After downloading, the compiled Linux binary will launch.
#
# USAGE:
#
# To launch the latest installed build of the default branch:
#       ./godot.sh [launch]
# To update the default branch:
#       ./godot.sh pull [godot|demos|self]
# To build the default branch:
#       ./godot.sh build
# To pull and build the default branch:
#       ./godot.sh upgrade
#
# CONFIG:
#
# An optional config file can be created as ~/.gitgodot.conf.
# Setting the following option will change the default engine branch (default is master):
#       ENGINEBRANCH=master
# Setting the following option will change where the engine code is stored:
#       ENGINEPATH=/path/to/godot/code
# Setting the following option will change the default demos branch (default is master):
#       DEMOBRANCH=master
# Setting the following option will change where the demo projects are stored:
#       DEMOPATH=/path/to/godot/demos
# Setting the following option will change where we download the temporary copy of the latest version of this script:
#	TMPDIR=/tmp
# Setting the following option will allow multi-job compiling for the git option. Set to number of CPU cores to use:
#       CORES=4
#
# NOTES:
#
# As of version 2.3, the script will check for newer versions. However, you can always find
# the latest version yourself on Github here:
#
# https://github.com/adolson/godot-stuff/blob/master/godot.sh
# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adolson/godot-stuff/master/godot.sh
#
# It is licensed under the X11/Expat/"MIT" terms (whatever the Godot Engine uses)
#
# CHANGELOG:
#
# 5.0 - Fully rewritten
#
# As of version 5.0, this script has been changed such that most of the old changelog is no
# longer relevant. You can check out older commits if you wish to adopt it and modify it
# such that it functions with the changes made in the years since it was last updated.
